# Bazago
Bazago is a demonstration of a website for efficient grocery shopping. Basically, this was my project of Database Systems course.

The concept of this website is somewhat like Trivago. It shows you the best price for each item (for instance, potato) and where you can find it.

It contains features like:
- Shows the best price for each item from the shops around you,
- Helps the users to send requests to change the prices if they found out that the price has dropped,
- Better admin & user interface,
- A search option etc.
